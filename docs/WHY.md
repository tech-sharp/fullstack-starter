## Developer Experience

### Rust-based Toolchain

We prioritize **speed** across the entire development workflow by choosing Rust-based tools:

- **Biome**: Linter + formatter in one tool, 100x faster than ESLint + Prettier
- **uv**: Python package manager, 10-100x faster than pip/poetry
- **Turbopack**: Next.js bundler, faster than Webpack
- **Lightning CSS**: TailwindCSS v4 compiler, 100x faster than PostCSS

### mise

- **Polyglot monorepo support**: Node, Python, Flutter, Terraform — different ecosystems, one tool
- **Project-local versions**: `.mise.toml` ensures consistent environments across OS during developer onboarding
- **Task runner**: Replace Makefile, npm scripts, shell scripts with unified `mise` commands
- **Written in Rust**: Instant tool switching, no startup overhead

### Polyglot Monorepo

- **Single repository**: Web (TypeScript), API (Python), Mobile (Dart), Infra (HCL) in one place
- **Bounded contexts**: Each language ecosystem is scoped to its directory, preventing cross-contamination
- **Atomic changes**: Frontend + backend changes in single PR
- **Unified tooling**: Same `mise` commands across all apps

## Trade-offs

| Choice | Trade-off | Why We Accept It |
